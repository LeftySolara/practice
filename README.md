# Practice

This repository is a collection of code I've written during active learning of CS concepts.

The code contained here is not necessarily the cleanest or most efficient; it is written
in whatever way best helps me understand a given topic. For each topic, I will include 
a list of references used during my studies.

Many (if not all) of the topics here will end up in my [personal knowledge base](https://docs.jalenkadams.me).
