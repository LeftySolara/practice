# Graphs

A **graph** is an abstract data structure that models the relationships in a set
of objects.

## Basics

Graphs are made up of vertices and edges. **Vertices** contain data, and edges represent
a connection between vertices.

A **directed graph** has edges with one-way relationships, while an **undirected graph** has relationships that are bidirectional.

Some quick vocabulary:

- Loop: An edge that connects to the same vertex on both ends.
- Cycle: Path in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last ones.
- Edge Weight: Any value assigned to an edge.
- Vertex Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex.
